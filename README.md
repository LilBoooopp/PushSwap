# PushSwap
My attempt at the pushswap 42 project.

This project got 100% as it passes all the requirements for the amount of moves allowed.

The algorithm used is the "turk" or "turkish" which in a nutshell keeps 1 stack always sorted. 
Next, it calculates the least amount of moves to push a value from the unsorted stack A to the sorted stack B.

Feel free to test it and report any bugs.
